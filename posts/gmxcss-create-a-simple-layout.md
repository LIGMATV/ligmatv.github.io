Second, we built the simple navigation. And also it was really responsive! In desktop, it will showed in left and vertical, meanwhille in mobile, it will showed in bottom and horizontal.

```
<main>
  <aside>
    <nav>
      <li class="active">
        <i>
          <iconify-icon icon="material-symbols:home"></iconify-icon>
        </i>
        <span>Home</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/LIGMATV/gmx.css">
          <i>
            <iconify-icon icon="mdi:github"></iconify-icon>
          </i>
          <span>GitHub</span>
        </a>
      </li>
    </nav>
    <article>
    </article>
  </aside>
</main>
```
