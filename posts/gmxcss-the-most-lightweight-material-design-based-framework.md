I used to create my website with [Beer.css](https://www.beercss.com/), it's very lightweight and easy to reusable the components and customizable. And later, i found [M3 Svelte](https://ktibow.github.io/m3-svelte/) which have a perfect Material Design Guideline and good-looking too, but sadly that framework is just for Svelte framework, meanwhille me just HTML5 framework. So i decide to make my own framework...

## Understanding

GMX.css is an new CSS framework that implements the Material 3 design system in Vanilla CSS/JS, from the components to the animations to the theming. I used to make this framework for my own, but i decide to publish it on GitHub. That's because there's already a bunch of components already (Thought it's just realeased in yesterday).

## Feature

It's was really lighweight. So far, with 15 components already implemented, the unminified (full) version size is just **19,3 KB!** Thought it has a lot of variables and utilities. But this framework is not yet stable, so there are still many things that untidy so that this framework is still not perfect. But it's already responsive!
